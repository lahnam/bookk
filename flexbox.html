                <p>The hours of the waiting and wandering of what the
                    stars confess to the sky. The moon and the dim
                    starlight and you humming to a distant song that
                    carries a soothing aura to kiss my cheeks. I touch
                    my heart and it's in harmony. I turn to look at you
                    dancing at midnight. And I wonder of all the
                    promises I have kept. And I know why I am blessed
                    to such moments.</p>

                <p>There are people who won't
                    return your love
                    it doesn't mean that you
                    should stop loving
                    your love is a ray of hope
                    it brings you peace
                    you are capable enough to
                    decide what you want
                    do not wait for others to return
                    your love to spread happiness
                    go change the world.</p>
